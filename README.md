# Plant Disease Detection
## Description
This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using machine learning models built with Python. It utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Keras to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results. The goal is to accurately identify diseases in plants from images, helping farmers and gardeners maintain healthy crops.

Usage

### To use the model for detecting plant diseases, follow these steps:

Place your plant images in the data/ directory.
Run the script to preprocess images and make predictions:
python predict.py --image data/your-image.jpg

The script will output the predicted disease and the confidence level.

## Features

Image Preprocessing: Handles image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model Training: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras.
Disease Prediction: Predicts diseases from plant images with high accuracy.
Visualization: Visualizes model performance and predictions using Matplotlib.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased plants. The data is sourced from Kaggle, and it includes various plant species and disease types.

## Model Architecture
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with several layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
Dense Layers: Classify the features into specific plant diseases.
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
